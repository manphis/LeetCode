'''
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
'''

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

    def guessNumber(self, n):

        low = 1
        high = n
        while True:
            num = int((low+high)/2)
            r = guess(num)
            if r == 0:
                return num
            elif r == 1:
                low = num + 1
            else:
                high = num - 1
